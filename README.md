# Combine-DNA-ligand


A streamlined tool designed to help users easily merge ligand .gro files with DNA or protein .gro files with minimal effort. <br>
This script automates residue renumbering, atom count updates, and ligand insertion — simplifying GROMACS system preparation for molecular dynamics simulations.

Features
- Append ligand coordinates to a protein or DNA .gro file
- Automatically update atom counts and renumber residues
- Interactive mode: user chooses how many ligand copies to insert
- Supports any ligand generated by acpype
- Maintains strict .gro formatting and no manual editing required

Requirements
- Bash (Linux/macOS or WSL on Windows)
- GROMACS (required for renumbering)
- acpype (for generating ligand .gro files)
