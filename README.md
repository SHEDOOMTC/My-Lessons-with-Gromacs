# Combine-DNA-ligand


A streamlined tool designed to help users easily merge ligand .gro files with DNA or protein .gro files with minimal effort. <br>
This script automates residue renumbering, atom count updates, and ligand insertion — simplifying GROMACS system preparation for molecular dynamics simulations.

Features
- Append ligand coordinates to a protein or DNA .gro file
- Automatically update atom counts
- Automatically renumber residues
- Interactive mode: user chooses how many ligand copies to insert
- Supports any ligand generated by acpype
- Maintains strict .gro formatting
- Fully compatible with GROMACS workflows
- No manual editing required

Requirements
- Bash (Linux/macOS or WSL on Windows)
- GROMACS (required for renumbering)
- acpype (for generating ligand .gro files)
- GNU coreutils (sed, awk, tail, head, wc)
