# Combine-DNA-ligand


A streamlined tool designed to help users easily merge ligand .gro files with DNA or protein .gro files with minimal effort. <br>
This script automates residue renumbering, atom count updates, and ligand insertion — simplifying GROMACS system preparation for molecular dynamics simulations.

# Features
- Append ligand coordinates to a protein or DNA .gro file
- Automatically update atom counts and renumber residues
- Interactive mode: user chooses how many ligand copies to insert
- Supports any ligand generated by acpype
- Maintains strict .gro formatting and no manual editing required

# Requirements
- Bash (Linux/macOS or WSL on Windows)
- GROMACS (required for renumbering)
- acpype (for generating ligand .gro files)

# Installation
```bash
#Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/SHEDOOMTC/My-Lessons-with-Gromacs.git
cd Combine-DNA-ligand
#copy your ligand and DNA/protein gro file into Combine-DNA-ligand/
# Make executable
chmod +x njiko-DNA-na-ligand.sh
```

# Usage

```bash
./njiko-DNA-na-ligand.sh ligand.gro DNA/Protein.gro

```
# Interactive prompts:

```text
How many times should the ligand be appended? [1]: 
```
Enter number: 1, 2, 3, etc.

# Note 
```text
The name of the DNA/Protein.gro file will also become the name of the complex produced

```

# The script will then:
- Insert the ligand the specified number of times
- Update the atom count and renumber residues
- Preserve .gro formatting
- Produce a clean, simulation‑ready complex.gro
